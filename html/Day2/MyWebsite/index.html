       A web developer is a professional who builds and maintains websites and web applications. They work on both the front-end (what users see) and back-end (server and database) of a site. Web developers use programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and others to create functional, user-friendly sites. They ensure websites are responsive, secure, and perform well across different devices. Web developers often collaborate with designers, content creators, and other developers to bring digital ideas to life.

        Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves front-end development, which focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development handles server-side logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Python, PHP, or Node.js. Web developers often work with frameworks such as React, Angular, or Django to build efficient and scalable applications. Responsive design ensures websites work well on all devices. Security, performance, and user experience are key considerations. Web development is constantly evolving with new tools and technologies. It plays a vital role in digital communication and business.
